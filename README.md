# Coders-SB-Club-Project

## What is the purpose of this project?

This project is a pedagogical tool intended for grade students interested in learning about the human body.

## How is this project designed?

The package has multiple webpages, each of which depicts some part of the human body. These pages have clickable links that take you to the parts that make up that part of the body. For example, a diagram depicting the eye might have links to the optic nerve, retina, etc.
